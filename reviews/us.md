### Needs offline feature to deserve 5*

★★★★★ ios 5 was the best, 2016-11-16

```
Pros: unlike all other IM apps, this does not require access to your contacts. True privacy unlike whatsapp and signal and telegram! Also you are in control of your private/public keypair, something the other don't offer.

Cons: no offline (yet)

But I'm giving five anyway because the developer is doing his best (I'm a beta tester) and offline functionality depends on solving a complex set of requirements by apple regarding background processing and the way tox network works.

However I'm hopeful that this will happen one day.

### Clean and Simple

I am optimistic that this app will have a name in the future that is near

This app is like a vacuum cleaner *I know that is a weird comparison*, But what do you do when you buy a brand new vacuum? You simply plug it to the wall and use it! How complicated is that!

Here you just create a username and a password *No email or phone verification* and there you have it.. Phone/Video calls.. add a friend.. share files.. everything is out there and that is great for Generation X!

(There is some drops in the app but no crashes yet)

I gave AT five stars because I am optimistic about it as I said and certain that there will be updates soon enough with more features and more stability!
