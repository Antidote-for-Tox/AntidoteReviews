###Needs offline feature to deserve 5*

★★★★★ ios 5 was the best, 2016-11-16, **US**

```
Pros: unlike all other IM apps, this does not require access to your contacts. True privacy unlike whatsapp and signal and telegram! Also you are in control of your private/public keypair, something the other don't offer.

Cons: no offline (yet)

But I'm giving five anyway because the developer is doing his best (I'm a beta tester) and offline functionality depends on solving a complex set of requirements by apple regarding background processing and the way tox network works.

However I'm hopeful that this will happen one day.

###Clean and Simple

I am optimistic that this app will have a name in the future that is near

This app is like a vacuum cleaner *I know that is a weird comparison*, But what do you do when you buy a brand new vacuum? You simply plug it to the wall and use it! How complicated is that!

Here you just create a username and a password *No email or phone verification* and there you have it.. Phone/Video calls.. add a friend.. share files.. everything is out there and that is great for Generation X!

(There is some drops in the app but no crashes yet)

I gave AT five stars because I am optimistic about it as I said and certain that there will be updates soon enough with more features and more stability!

Der Tox Client ist für Version 1.1.0 sehr gut 😀 und beeindruckt mit der Performance. 

Was auf jeden Fall noch gemeistert werden muss ist, dass wenn die Gegenstelle nicht zum gleichen Zeitpunkt online ist, dennoch eine Message zukommen zu lassen. 

Ansonsten topp 👍🏻

Приложение из разряда "приятная неожиданность "! Голосовые звонки на высочайшем уровне-слышимость покруче чем у известных шмибера и гавнатцапа, все очень лаконично в чате и надеюсь защита от прослушки будет на высоте-всем советую!

Почему клиенты под андроид и PC позволяют отправлять сообщение пользователю, который оффлайн, а это приложение - нет?
